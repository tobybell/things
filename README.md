# Things

This was a project from quite a long time ago---I'm not sure when; maybe 2017-18---that I never added to Git. The basic idea was to create a content/knowledge management app that I could use for a wide variety of purposes, and for developing useful software quickly in a sort of generic framework. Take a look at the visual design screenshots to get a sense of what I mean.

## Status

- I didn't do much significant work on this other than visual design.
- Unlikely to resume development.
- Maybe will incorporate some design ideas from this into a different project in the future.
